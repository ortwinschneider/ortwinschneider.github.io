# Bobbycar - Cloud-native IoT architecture

Bobbycar is a distributed cloud-native application that implements **key aspects** of a modern **IoT architecture** in an exemplary manner. 
This demo is based on Red Hat's Kubernetes Distribution, **Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform**, and uses various middleware components optimized for a cloud-native usage.

## About

Bobbycars are actually vehicle simulators implemented in **Quarkus**, simulating cars and sending telemetry data to an IoT Cloud Gateway.

The data is then being used in different data processing flows for visualization, realtime analytics, machine learning and other use cases.

## Purpose

+ Accelerate building IoT solutions faster with Red Hat technologies.
  
+ Bobbycar aims to showcase the COMPLETE Red Hat Middleware stack on OpenShift in a real world IoT context.

+ Getting a more realistic hands-on experience with cloud-native development and OpenShift
